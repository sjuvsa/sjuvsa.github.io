	<h3>Mission</h3>
	<p>The Vietnamese Student Association at St. John's University is one of the fastest growing organizations on the SJU campus and is also a chapter under the Northeast VSA region.
	We seek to create an organization under the basis of academics/professionalism as well as a social community. We strive to promote networking among college students and create involvement within our members and encourage them to be an active asset in their own communities. 
	We want to spread Vietnamese culture and traditions while also acknowledging other ethnic backgrounds within our campus as well as other schools across the nation.</p>
